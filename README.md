Vigenere.go
============

a twist on the old code paradigm: instead of just slapping a git repo around
some old code, I've decided to do a quick rewrite of what was (originally)
ancient Python code in Go.

I should note that this is a _direct_ translation, i.e. no improvements have been
made to the algorithm, just a quick exercise in polyglot-ism
